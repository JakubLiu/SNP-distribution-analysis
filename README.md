# SNP-distribution-analysis
Materials from a project working on NGS &amp; WGS data. The aim of this project was to answer the question: Is the SNP distribution uniform or not amongst human exons and introns? 

This project consisted of 4 main steps:

  1.) filtering the input (VCF) data (VCFtools, Variant Effect Predictor)
  2.) analysing the SNP distribution (various custom written bash scripts)
  3.) visualisation of the results (Python) and statistical analysis of the results (R)
  4.) interpretation of the results and writign the publication
